# TRENITALIA CLIENT
----  

A pretty basic and (hopefully) psr7 compliant client for Trenitalia APIs, almost solely based on [SimoDax] reference.  

## CONTRIBUTING
----  
Always welcome, since this package is mostly meant and tailored on my personal usage (so a lot of stuff probably useful for anybody else may still be missing).
